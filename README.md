# EasyShare

EasyShare is a peer to peer file sharing application, which uses WebRTC API to transfer files between peers without any intermediate servers. EasyShare does not store any of your files. After uploading a file, user can share the generated link/QR code to any number of peers, who can download the file. Transfers are encrypted and file downloads can continue as long as the link/QR code page remains open.

## Development

This application was developed using Angular framework, PeerJS library as a wrapper around WebRTC APIs, and containerized using docker. A deployed version of the application is available at https://easy-share-app-prod.herokuapp.com.
